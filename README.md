# Overview

This project is to help me understand web apps, and how to develop web applications Using react along with JavaScript HTML,and CSS. I want to gain a better understanding of web development and the necessary tools to become a full stack developer.  

This application opens up on a homepage that presents a beautiful loaf of bread, and explains that the Web App is a cookbook, then indicates that you should push the button on the image to see a recipe for bread. This image then takes you to the recipe and subsequent interactions you can make with the program. I to run I'll enter my terminal access the file, then input "npm start" to start the server and the page opens on my browser.

I wrote this software to be helpful to my wife when she is Cooking and especially baking. My wife loves to cook and bake and this is a tool that can keep her recipes in order and help her follow along as she cooks. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

 I am using react to create segment or app on my react file, which are then linked together. The React uses a extension of react-router-dom To create multiple pages and link the pages togetherTo create multiple pages and link the pages together. The homepage contains a little information and a link to the recipe page which then contains a recipe and interactive checklist for ingredients. 

# Development Environment

I used VScode along with React, I used a mixture of forums and tutorial videos to gain a visual idea of how the program should be structured, and written. 

I used React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the programming of this application.

# Future Work

* I want to add a long list of recipes to convert my wife's cookbook into a Interactive digital version. 
* I want to gain a better understanding of formatting for react. I feel that my work seems sloppy and a little bit all over the place. I want to clean it up and make it easier to read. 
* I want to add a search bar for easy access of wanted recipes.
