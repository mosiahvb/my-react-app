# Overview

This project is to help me understand web apps, and how to develop web applications Using react along with JavaScript HTML,and CSS. I want to gain a better understanding of web development and the necessary tools to become a full stack developer.  

{Provide a description the web app that you wrote. Describe how to start a test server on your computer and what website to open up to see the first page of the app.}

I wrote this software to be helpful to my wife when she is Cooking and especially baking. My wife loves to cook and bake and this is a tool that can keep her recipes in order and help her follow along as she cooks. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

{Describe each of the web pages you created and how the web app transitions between each of them.  Also describe what is dynamically created on each page.}

# Development Environment

I used VScode along with React, I used a mixture of forums and tutorial videos to gain a visual idea of how the program should be structured, and written. 

I used React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the programming of this application.

# Future Work

* I want to add a long list of recipes to convert my wife's cookbook into a Interactive digital version. 
* I want to gain a better understanding of formatting for react. I feel that my work seems sloppy and a little bit all over the place. I want to clean it up and make it easier to read. 
* I want to add a search bar for easy access of wanted recipes.
